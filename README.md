# NUMANA

This is my side project for my Numerical Analysis class.

I plan to create a library named "NUMANA" for linear algebra calculations.
HOWEVER, FIRST, I'm working on developing a Conjugate Gradient function.

## RUN

`make`

## Environment

- X86_64
- ubuntu
- gcc (Ubuntu 11.4.0-1ubuntu1~22.04) 11.4.0
